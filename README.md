# SocialMediaDataAnalysis

This is a project I did for an organization where I analyzed their quarterly social media data and provided my insights

Data Source - https://github.com/ramansandhu17/SocialMediaDataAnalysis/blob/main/Social%20Media%20Data.xlsx

STEP 1 - DATA EXPLORATION USING EXCEL
  - Cleaned the headers of the file and included the weekday column to get insights on the posts per day.
  - Checked each column to verify the data types.
  - Cleaned duplicate values.
  - Cleaned data to only include Quarter 1 data.

STEP 2 - Data Cleaning using Python
  - Please see main.py file
Step 3 - Data Visualization
